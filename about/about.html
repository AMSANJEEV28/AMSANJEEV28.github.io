            Well hello there, it's your favorite multi-hyphenate,
            <span class="color">A M Sanjeev</span>! I'm a
            <b
              >third-year computer science engineering student at Gurukula
              Kangri Deemed to be University Haridwar</b
            >, and boy do I have my hands full!
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and in case you were wondering what I look like, here's a
            picture of me:
          </p>
          <img

            alt="A M Sanjeev profile picture"
          />
          <p class="color">
            I call this my 'serious face,' but it's really just my 'trying not
            to laugh' face.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not busy pretending to know what I'm doing as a
            <b>teaching assistant at Pupilfirst</b> or contributing
            <b>technical content to Dev Academy</b>, I'm juggling more titles
            than a circus performer.
            <b>Founder and student head coordinator of Charabanc club?</b>
            Check. <b>Software tester at TestIO?</b> Check.
            <b>Global Digital Corps FieldOps Cadet?</b> Check.
            <b>Student Coordinator at Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Club?</b>
            Check. <b>Jnanagni website developer?</b> Check.
            <b>Freelance web developer and content writer?</b> Check.
            <b>NSS Volunteer?</b> Check. Phew, I'm out of breath just saying all
            that!
          </p>

          <p>
            But don't be fooled by all those fancy titles, I'm just a simple guy
            with a love for web development, content writing, event planning,
            and leading teams. Oh, and let's not forget my love for puns - I've
            got more puns than lines of code!
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking of coding, I have a wide range of skills that I've honed
            over the years, including <i>C, C++, Python, Java and MySQL</i>. I'm
            also well-versed in
            <i>Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</i> just to name a
            few. In fact, my top skills include
            <i
              >HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, Node.js, Ruby on Rails and
              Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</i
            >, so you can rest assured that I know my way around the latest and
            greatest technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not busy being a tech superhero, you can find me indulging
            in my other interests like exploring new technologies, learning new
            skills, and trying to convince myself that I have time for hobbies.
            But hey, life is short, and I want to do it all!
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to all that, I'm also the
            <b
              >Student Head of the Magazine Editorial Team of FET's Quarterly
              Magazine</b
            >, where I put my writing skills to the test. And if that's not
            enough, I've even started learning computer programming at
            <b>Code in Place</b>, a course offered by
            <b>Stanford University!</b> So, if you thought I was busy before,
            think again!
          </p>

          <p>
            So, if you want to chat about coding, exchange puns, or just have a
            good laugh, hit me up at <a href="tel:9608685873">9608685873</a>,
            shoot me an email at
            <a href="mailto:amsanjeev28@gmail.com" target="_blank"
              >amsanjeev28@gmail.com</a
            >, or drop me a line at

          <p>
            I'm always down to connect with fellow techies and jokesters! and if
            you're in dire need of some A+ quality contents or codes, worry not,
            for I'm here to save the day! However, my exceptional skills don't
            come cheap, so brace yourselves to part with some of your
            hard-earned moolah. But trust me, it'll be worth every penny! Until
            next time, keep coding (and laughing) like a boss!
