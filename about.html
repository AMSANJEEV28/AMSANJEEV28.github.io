            Well hello there, it's your favorite multi-hyphenate,
            <span class="color">A M Sanjeev</span>! I'm a third-year computer
            science engineering student at Gurukula Kangri Deemed to be
            University Haridwar, and boy do I have my hands full!
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and in case you were wondering what I look like, here's a
            picture of me:
          </p>
          <img src="assets/amsanjeev.png" alt="A M Sanjeev profile picture" />
          <p class="color">
            I call this my 'serious face,' but it's really just my 'trying not
            to laugh' face.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not busy pretending to know what I'm doing as a teaching
            assistant at Pupilfirst or contributing technical content to Dev
            Academy, I'm juggling more titles than a circus performer. Founder
            and student head coordinator of Charabanc club? Check. Software
            tester at TestIO? Check. Global Digital Corps FieldOps Cadet? Check.
            Student Coordinator at Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Club? Check.
            Jnanagni website developer? Check. Freelance web developer and
            content writer? Check. NSS Volunteer? Check. Phew, I'm out of breath
            just saying all that!
          </p>

          <p>
            But don't be fooled by all those fancy titles, I'm just a simple guy
            with a love for web development, content writing, event planning,
            and leading teams. Oh, and let's not forget my love for puns - I've
            got more puns than lines of code!
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking of coding, I have a wide range of skills that I've honed
            over the years, including <i>C, C++, Python, Java and MySQL</i>. I'm
            also well-versed in
            <i>Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</i> just to name a
            few. In fact, my top skills include
            <i
              >HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, Node.js, Ruby on Rails and
              Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</i
            >, so you can rest assured that I know my way around the latest and
            greatest technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not busy being a tech superhero, you can find me indulging
            in my other interests like exploring new technologies, learning new
            skills, and trying to convince myself that I have time for hobbies.
            But hey, life is short, and I want to do it all!
          </p>

          <p>
            So, if you want to chat about coding, exchange puns, or just have a
            good laugh, hit me up at <a href="tel:9608685873">9608685873</a>,
            shoot me an email at
            <a href="mailto:amsanjeev28@gmail.com" target="_blank"
              >amsanjeev28@gmail.com</a
            >, or drop me a line at
            <a href="mailto:206320028@gkv.ac.in" target="_blank"

          <p>
            I'm always down to connect with fellow techies and jokesters! and if
            you're in dire need of some A+ quality contents or codes, worry not,
            for I'm here to save the day! However, my exceptional skills don't
            come cheap, so brace yourselves to part with some of your
            hard-earned moolah. But trust me, it'll be worth every penny! Until
            next time, keep coding (and laughing) like a boss!
