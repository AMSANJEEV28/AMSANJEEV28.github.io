              I was the big boss in charge of the official website for the
              techno cultural fest of Gurukula Kangri (Deemed to be University),
              Haridwar! Yes, I know it sounds fancy, but let's be real here, it
              was just a website. However, I take my role as a tech guru very
              seriously, even if I do code in my pajamas.
